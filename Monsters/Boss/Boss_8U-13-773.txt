Burrow Surge (can only use during Phase 2) : On an Initiative of 20, the burrowed 8U-13-773 targets a creature.  On an Initiative of 0, 8U-13-773 moves 20ft burrowed towards that creature.

How to play 8U-13-773 :
Phase 1 : Move towards the nearest creature and Multiattack.  If in a melee range of 2 or more Player Characters (PCs), split up Stomps between different PCs. Use Bite whenever access is given.   Use the Legendary Action : Spine Missile at the end of the top initiative player’s turn at the farthest PC within range, and use the Legendary Action : Fortify Armor at the end of the bottom initiative player’s turn.

Phase 2 : Burrow 8U-13-773 20ft down. The tunnel will fill itself back up upon their movement. Use Burrow Surge at the closest PC. Summon 8U-10, 8U-11, and 8U-12 within 30ft of 8U-13-773. Roll Initiative for 8U-10, 8U-11, 8U-12 (8U-Series).  8U-10 moves up to the nearest PC with Slam (remember the Taunting Slam Feature).  8U-11 as a bonus action uses Repair Command on the most injured of the 8U-Series, and then moves up and Slam a nearby PC. 8U-12 attacks with Spine Missile on the farthest PC within range. If the 8U-Series is destroyed (or removed from combat permanently in some way) - 8U-13-773 unburrows and repeat Phase 1 until Phase 3 is possible.

Phase 3 : Move towards the nearest creature and Multiattack. Use Bite whenever access is given. Use the Legendary Action : Spine Spread after the end of the top most initiative PC’s round (Legendary Action : Spine Missile still takes priority, so if that is still active, use Legendary Action : Spine Spread at the end of the second top most initiative PC’s round).

New Mechanic : Legendary Reaction
A Legendary Reaction follows the same rules as Reactions - however - it can be used even if the creature has already taken a Reaction - and does not take away from the creature’s Reaction usage (allowing Reactions to be used after a Legendary Reaction is taken).  When applicable - a creature can take multiple Legendary Reactions in a round.
